    <string name="dayone">Once upon a time, there was an alien named Vince who lived in Venus.</string>
    <string name="daytwo">His favorite food was vegetables but he could not grow them in Venus.</string>
    <string name="daythree"> One day, he decided to take a trip to Planet Earth.</string>
    <string name="dayfour">On Planet Earth, Vince snuck into a garden.</string>
    <string name="dayfive"> He looked to make sure no one was watching from the windows of the house. All he saw was a vase of flowers on the sill.  </string>
    <string name="daysix">He slowly started pulling lettuce and carrots from the ground. He pulled green beans and tomatoes off the vines.  </string>
    <string name="dayseven">He placed each veggie carefully into his velvet sack, happily thinking how rich they were in vitamins and minerals.  He only wished they had food like this on Venus!</string>
    <string name="dayeight">He was just about finished when he heard a voice. "I'm going to pick some beans for supper," a woman said as she came out of the house.  </string>
    <string name="daynine">Vince quickly vanished behind some tall stalks of corn.</string>
    <string name="dayten">"Hey, who's been stealing all my vegetables?" yelled the woman. "I'm going to find him right now!"  </string>
    <string name="dayeleven">With that, she started searching the garden.  He knew she would discover him if she got much closer. What was he going to do?</string>
    <string name="daytwelve">Looking over, Vince saw a rabbit hiding nearby. It must have heard the woman too, because it was lying low to the ground as if hiding.</string>
    <string name="daythirteen">The woman was coming closer by the second. Quickly, Vince grabbed the rabbit and pushed it out into the path, right into plain view.</string>
    <string name="dayfourteen">"Hey!" yelled the woman, surprised. The rabbit immediately started to run.  "Get back here!" The woman started to chase the rabbit.</string>
    <string name="dayfifteen">Vince quickly ran the other way, towards his hidden vehicle. He got in and started it up right away.  </string>
    <string name="daysixteen">Even though it just vibrated at first, it shot up into space almost immediately.</string>
    <string name="dayseventeen">"Phew!" thought Vince, and he opened his sack excitedly to look once again at his variety of vegetables.</string>
   
    <string name="dayones2"> Mommy, Daddy, and I were sitting in front of the TV watching our favorite movie.</string>
    <string name="daytwos2"> Suddenly, the face of a news reporter came onto the screen.</string>
    <string name="daythrees2"> “This is a news flash from station KIVB. The local police are leading a search for a group of wild animals that have escaped from the zoo."</string>
    <string name="dayfours2">"Wow. How do you think they got out?" I asked my parents.</string>
    <string name="dayfives2"> "Well, you see, my friend, Bob, here is a whiz at picking locks," there came a voice from the kitchen.  </string>
    <string name="daysixs2"> We all jumped and turned around to see a tiger in the middle of the kitchen floor. </string>
    <string name="daysevens2"> A monkey on his back smiled and said, "Oh, Duke, anyone could do it."  All of a sudden we heard a growl from the open refrigerator. </string>
    <string name="dayeights2">"Don't you guys have any meat in here?" A lion poked his head out from behind the door.  </string>
    <string name="daynines2">"Sorry, we're vegetarians. What do you animals want?" said the family.</string>
    <string name="daytens2">"Well, we'd love some dinner for starters. And we need a place to hide until the cops stop looking for us," said the animals. </string>
    <string name="dayelevens2">"What are you planning to do for the rest of your lives?  Keep running from the police?  They'll catch you eventually, you know," said the family.</string>
    <string name="daytwelves2">"Not if you help us, they won't.  Now, let's all sit down and start making a plan." </string>
    <string name="daythirteens2"> As the animals started talking with each other, I looked at my mom and dad.  Boy, this was going to be a long night.</string>
    
    <string name="dayones3"> Once upon a time there was a cat named Alex.</string>
    <string name="daytwos3"> Alex loved to play with his other cat friend Bruce.</string>
    <string name="daythrees3"> Shiny bags were his favorite.</string>
    <string name="dayfours3"> Alex liked climbing around.</string>
    <string name="dayfives3"> One day, Alex and Bruce climbed outside to explore!  </string>
    <string name="daysixs3"> They got scared and decided to come back inside</string>
    <string name="daysevens3"> Then they went back to playing with the shiny bag.</string>
    <string name="dayeights3">Finally after a long day Alex deserved some nice long rest.</string>
   
    <string name="dayones4"> There once was a bowl full of all kind of fruits. </string>
    <string name="daytwos4"> There was an apple, an orange, a banana, a pumpkin, and even a lemon.</string>
    <string name="daythrees4"> One day they all started to talk about what they wanted to be when they got out of the bowl. When banana got out of the bowl he wanted to become a banana split. </string>
    <string name="dayfours4"> Orange wanted to be an orange juice.</string>
    <string name="dayfives4"> Pumpkin said he wanted to become some delicious pumpkin pie.  </string>
    <string name="daysixs4"> Lemon finally said that he wanted be part of the best lemonade ever created.</string>
    <string name="daysevens4"> Then they all turned to apple. “What do you want to be?” said banana. But she did not know.</string>
    <string name="dayeights4"> New fruit came into the bowl like a strawberry, but then she left and apple was left alone again.</string>
    <string name="daynines4"> A peach also came into the bowl but was soon taken away just like strawberry.</string>
    <string name="daytens4"> Apple thought about becoming an apple pie but she did not want to copy pumpkin so she decided not to. </string>
    <string name="dayelevens4"> Then apple thought about becoming a caramel apple but that was too sweet.</string>
    <string name="daytwelves4"> On day finally someone took apple out of the fruit bowl and took her away.</string>
    <string name="daythirteens4"> She later discovered that she was given as a present to a teacher, and that made apple very happy.</string>
